I USED RANDOM FOREST MODEL AND IT GAVE ME 89 % ACCURACY AND THE
 MODEL IS SAVED IN ids_model.pkl and its preprocessor is saved in preprocessor.pkl

 I ALSO USED NEURAL NETWORKS AND IT GAVE ME SOMEWHAT SAME ACCURACY AROUND 89% 
 IF YOU RUN THIS CODE IT WILL USE THE RANDOM FOREST MODEL BUT IT ALSO CONTAINS THE TRAINED MODEL FOR NEURAL NETWORKS
 SO U JUST GOT TO CHANGE THE LIVE_ANALYSIS.PY FILE IN ORDER TO HANDLE DATA AS PER NEURAL NETWORK REQUIREMENTS
